# Comet Chat

### Summary
---
Comet Chat is a real time chat application inspired by the sunsets in my home state, Arizona. 
The real time interaction is handled via SignalR and all data is stored in a SQL Server. 
The front-end was built using React, Redux, and Typescript. The back-end is ASP.Net Core.â€©
